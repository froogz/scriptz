### Why It Matters

The Book of Enoch is one of the most talked-about forbidden scriptures. Readers ask:

### Why was the Book of Enoch removed from the Bible?

It was excluded from the biblical canon by early church leaders who feared its visions of angels, giants, and divine judgment challenged established doctrine.

### Why is the Book of Enoch banned or forbidden?

For over 1,000 years it was hidden because of its apocalyptic prophecies, its stories of fallen angels, and its unsettling secrets about the end of days.

### What is the big deal about the Book of Enoch?

It gives a vivid vision of heaven, cosmic battles, and moral warnings that echo issues still relevant today: unrestrained power, corrupted justice, and the search for truth.

### Should I trust the Book of Enoch?

For historians and seekers, it is a window into ancient thought, not a replacement for scripture. It reveals how early believers struggled with questions of justice, creation, and divine mystery.

!!! info "Did You Know?"

    :fontawesome-solid-book: Who Wrote the Book of Enoch?

    Tradition says it was written by Enoch, the great-grandfather of Noah. Scholars believe it was composed between 300 BCE and 100 CE, a collection of apocalyptic visions passed down through generations.

    :fontawesome-solid-book: Is the Book of Enoch true?

    Historically, it is a preserved record of ancient beliefs and prophecies. Spiritually, its truth depends on the seeker’s path.

    :fontawesome-solid-book: Who removed it from the Bible?

    Early church councils and leaders, who chose to preserve a narrower canon, left it out.

These aren’t just lost pages. They are crossroads — between faith and myth, history and speculation, the known and the hidden.
