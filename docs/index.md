# **Unveiling The Forgotten**

For centuries, entire books were erased from the story of faith and history. Cast out, hidden in vaults, whispered about in fragments. But shadows don’t silence words forever. They wait.

## **Why These Books Matter Today**

Prophecies about fallen angels and giants sound distant — until you notice the echoes in today’s world. Knowledge racing faster than wisdom. Power unrestrained. Questions about justice, endings, and beginnings that still linger in every age.

Reading the forbidden isn’t about curiosity alone. It’s about rediscovering the conversations our ancestors once had — and realizing why those voices were silenced.

!!! info "Did You Know?"

    :fontawesome-solid-book: The Book of Enoch was quoted by New Testament authors but later banned for over 1,000 years.

    :fontawesome-solid-book: Surveys show 65% of readers explore apocryphal texts out of curiosity, even if they don’t identify with a religion.

    :fontawesome-solid-book: The Apocrypha was once standard in many Bibles and still survives in Eastern and Orthodox traditions today.

These aren’t just lost pages. They are crossroads — between faith and myth, history and speculation, the known and the hidden.

## **Step Into the Vision**

At Midnight Manuscripts, we bring back what was forgotten: apocalyptic visions, forbidden scriptures, and stories too dangerous to stay buried.

Start your journey with **The Book of Enoch: An Apocalyptic Vision**. Then continue into The **Apocrypha Anthology**. More revelations are coming. The shadows aren’t empty — they’re full of voices waiting to be heard.
