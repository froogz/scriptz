The imagery is haunting, the pace unpredictable, and I kept thinking about it long after I finished. It feels less like reading and more like uncovering something I wasn\u2019t supposed to see.</p> <p>\u2014 Alex M., 29</p> <p>I\u2019ve read a lot of apocryphal texts, but nothing written like this. It\u2019s cinematic, it\u2019s unsettling, and it\u2019s alive. The calendar section alone made me question everything I thought I knew. Midnight Manuscripts is onto something.</p> <p>\u2014 Rachel T., 34</p> <p>Not a comfortable read\u2026 and that\u2019s exactly the point.
